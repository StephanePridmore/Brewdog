Bright, vibrant aromas of tangerine, mandarin and peach, with zesty hits of lime, envelop the nutty, caramel malt backbone. The intense fruitiness gives a jammy quality to the nose. On the palate is a warm biscuity sweetness, with tropical fruits in a supporting role to a huge grapefruit and orange bitterness.',
